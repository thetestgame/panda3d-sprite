The panda3d-sprite module provides spritesheet capabilities to the Panda3D game engine. This module is a modification and slight redesign of work done by Panda3D forum user ZeroByte. The original forum post can be located <a href="https://discourse.panda3d.org/t/pixel-art-sprite-cards/5142">here</a>

panda3d-sprite can be used to load static sprites, animated sprites, and layered sprites for sprites with clothing options.
